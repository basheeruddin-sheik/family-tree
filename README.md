## API Endpoints
1. FamilyTreeController
    * ```family-tree/generate - POST``` Generate the family
        ```
        // Response Format
        {
            message: string;
            isValidFamilyDescription: boolean;
            tree: {
                node: string;
                parents: string[];
                relationNameWithUser: string;
                gender: string;
            }[];
        }
        ```

## TODOs
1. Refine the prompt by examining various examples with intricate family relationships to get more accuracy.
2. Fine-tune the model for this specific use case by providing a dataset related to relationships.
3. Will use Langchain chunking process for splitting large inputs into smaller, manageable parts to fit within the token limit of language models while preserving the context and coherence of the information.
4. Implement authentication & API authorization.
